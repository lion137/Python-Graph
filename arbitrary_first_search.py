# Arbitrary first search function (AFS) - on graph and vertex.
# Takes a graph G and a vertex s and returns all the nodes of the Graph reachable from s.
# This algorithm also check if graph is connected, finds connected components of s and, also,
# tests if s can reach given vertex t.
# As well as returns Spanning Tree (connected sub set of the edges of connected graph
#  which uses the all of the vertices) of connected components rooted in s;
# in the other words is minimum set of the edges connects the all vertices of G.
# A data structure a bag is just like a bag, doesn't return items in any
# particular order; there are more detailed implementations: dfs, bfs.
